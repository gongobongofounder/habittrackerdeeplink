# 🚨 URGENT: Fix 404 on Deep Links

## Problem
`https://habittracker.atraj.it/habit/123` shows 404 error because GitHub Pages treats it as a missing file.

## Solution
Add a `404.html` file that redirects all routes to `index.html`.

## 🔧 Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### **Upload This File:**

Upload the new `404.html` file to your GitHub repository:

**Location:** Same location as `index.html` (root of repository)

**File:** `404.html` (already created in this folder)

## 📝 Step-by-Step:

### Option 1: Upload via GitHub Web UI (Easiest)

1. Go to your repo: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/habittracker-deeplink`
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag `404.html` from this folder
4. Commit changes
5. Wait 2 minutes for GitHub to rebuild
6. Test: `https://habittracker.atraj.it/habit/1` ✓

### Option 2: Git Command Line

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
cp E:\CodingWorld\AndroidAppDev\HabitTracker\github-pages-deploy\404.html .
git add 404.html
git commit -m "Add 404.html to handle deep link routes"
git push
```

### Option 3: Replace ALL Files

Upload all files from `github-pages-deploy` folder again:

- `.well-known/assetlinks.json`
- `CNAME`
- `README.md`

## ✅ How It Works:

### Before (404 Error):
```
1. User clicks: https://habittracker.atraj.it/habit/123
2. GitHub Pages looks for file: /habit/123
3. File not found → 404 error ❌
```

### After (Works!):
```
1. User clicks: https://habittracker.atraj.it/habit/123
2. GitHub Pages looks for file: /habit/123
3. File not found → Shows 404.html
4. 404.html saves path and redirects to index.html
5. index.html reads saved path
6. index.html extracts habit ID
7. Opens app to habit #123 ✓
```
